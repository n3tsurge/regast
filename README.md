# regast
Regular Expression based Application Security Scanning Tool

## What is it?
Regast is a Regular Expression based Application Security scanning tool.  Why pay tons of money when you can just use regex to look for no brainer issues.

There may be some false positives, but it's better than nothing.  And the signatures can be tweaked! Just edit signatures.json!
